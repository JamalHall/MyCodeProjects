      <p> Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. <br> 
      Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. <br> 
       Do this for every letter, see example below!
        <br> 
        E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"
        <br> 
        Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.
