// // my solution
// Create a function that takes in a word and returns the word with the first letter capitalized.

// Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.


// Hint: Remember how we grabbed individual letters from the string in yesterday's problem. Combine that with modifying the first to be upper case. 


function wordIn(word){
    let splitWord = word.split('')
    let firstLetter = splitWord[0].toUpperCase()
    splitWord.shift() 
    splitWord.unshift(firstLetter)
    let capWord = splitWord.join('')
return capWord
}

console.log(wordIn('superman'),'Superman')
