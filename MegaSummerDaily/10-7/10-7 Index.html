      <h1> Combine all of the letters</h1>
      <div>
      <p> Create a function that takes in a word and returns the word with the first letter capitalized.

        Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.
        
        
        Hint: Remember how we grabbed individual letters from the string in yesterday's problem. Combine that with modifying the first to be upper case.
